# legal-aid-prototype
A prototype website answering basic questions about a specific issue of Czech law.

Done in 2021 as part of the "Innovation Lab" course where we tried out coming up with a project, testing its actual usefulness, improving it, coming up with a lean canvas business plan and presenting it to a professional audience. My project partner and I developed a prototype of a website which would help people on a decision tree basis with very specific everyday legal issues - template administrative and court letters.

Don't treat this as legal advice, it's a prototype and it isn't meant to be used for actual legal advice.
